## Brief
https://github.com/Kirsten-Osborn/GUH2019/blob/master/Screenshot%202019-11-16%20at%2012.11.52.png

## Assumptions
- 15 min flying time
- Max speed 120 km/hr
- Max range 30km (allow safety margin of 10km reduces this to 20km)
- Maximum of 4 passenger
- 'Ride hailing service' is on demand rather than scheduled service
- 40kg luggage allowance per passenger

## Questions for Airbus
- Safety requirements
- What impact does 1x landing and take off have on the 15min flying time
