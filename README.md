## Assumptions
- 15 min flying time starts when rotors started and stops when rotors stopped - take off and landing has no additional impact on flying time
- Max speed 120 km/hr
- Max range 30km (allow safety margin of 10km reduces this to 20km)
- Maximum of 4 passenger
- 'Ride hailing service' is on demand rather than scheduled service
- The PoC will involve 1 aircraft
- The aircraft will fly at 5,000 feet
- 40kg luggage allowance per passenger
